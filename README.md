# SBP-YOLO: Real-time Detection of Speed Bumps and Potholes

SBP-YOLO is a **lightweight and high-speed detection framework** for road speed bumps and potholes, tailored for embedded suspension control systems.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üöÄ **Efficient Backbone/Neck:** GhostConv + VoVGSCSPC for multi-scale feature extraction
- üîé **Small-object Detection:** P2 branch + Lightweight Efficient Detection Head (LEDH)
- üß† **Hybrid Training:** NWD loss + BCKD knowledge distillation + Albumentations augmentation
- üìà **Performance:** 87.0% mAP (+5.8% vs. YOLOv11n)
- ‚ö° **Deployment:** 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier (TensorRT FP16)

## üõ†Ô∏è Highlights

SBP-YOLO delivers **fast, accurate, and low-latency road condition perception** for real-time adaptive damping control in advanced suspension systems.

This is the implementation of the work:
